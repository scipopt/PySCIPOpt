Read and Write Files
#####################

While building your own optimization problem is fun, at some point you often need to share it, or
read an optimization problem written by someone else. For this you're going to need to
write the optimization problem to some file or read it from some file.

Model File Formats
=====================

SCIP has extensive support for a wide variety of file formats. The table below outlines
what formats those are and the model types they're associated with.

.. list-table:: Supported File Formats
  :widths: 25 25
  :align: center
  :header-rows: 1

  * - Extension
    - Model Type
  * - CIP
    - SCIP's constraint integer programming format
  * - CNF
    - DIMACS CNF (conjunctive normal form) format used for example for SAT problems
  * - DIFF
    - reading a new objective function for mixed-integer programs
  * - FZN
    - FlatZinc is a low-level solver input language that is the target language for MiniZinc
  * - GMS
    - mixed-integer nonlinear programs (GAMS) [reading requires compilation with GAMS=true and a working GAMS system]
  * - LP
    - mixed-integer (quadratically constrained quadratic) programs (CPLEX)
  * - MPS
    - mixed-integer (quadratically constrained quadratic) programs
  * - OPB
    - pseudo-Boolean optimization instances
  * - OSiL
    - mixed-integer nonlinear programs
  * - PIP
    - mixed-integer polynomial programming problems
  * - SOL
    - solutions; XML-format (read-only) or raw SCIP format
  * - WBO
    - weighted pseudo-Boolean optimization instances
  * - ZPL
    - ZIMPL models, i.e., mixed-integer linear and nonlinear programming problems [read only]


.. note:: In general we recommend sharing files using the ``.mps`` extension when possible.

  For a more human readable format for equivalent problems we recommend the ``.lp`` extension.

  For general non-linearities that are to be shared with others we recommend the ``.osil`` extension.

  For general constraint types that will only be used by other SCIP users we recommend the ``.cip`` extension.

.. note:: Some of these file formats may only have a reader programmed and not a writer. Additionally,
  some of these readers may require external plug-ins that are not shipped by default via PyPI.

Write a Model
================

To write a SCIP Model to a file one simply needs to run the command:

.. code-block:: python

  from pyscipopt import Model
  scip = Model()
  scip.writeProblem(filename="example_file.mps", trans=False, genericnames=False)

.. note:: Both ``trans`` and ``genericnames`` are there as their default values. The ``trans``
  option is available if you want to print the transformed problem (post presolve) instead
  of the model originally created. The ``genericnames`` option is there if you want to overwrite
  the variable and constraint names provided.

Read a Model
===============

To read in a file to a SCIP model one simply needs to run the command:

.. code-block:: python

  from pyscipopt import Model
  scip = Model()
  scip.readProblem(filename="example_file.mps")

This will read in the file and you will now have a SCIP model that matches the file.
Variables and constraints can be queried, with their names matching those in the file.
