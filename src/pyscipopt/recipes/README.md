# Recipes sub-package

This sub-package provides a set of functions for common usecases for pyscipopt. This sub-package is for all functions
that don't necessarily reflect the core functionality of SCIP, but are useful for working with the solver. The functions
implemented in this sub-package might not be the most efficient way to solve/formulate a problem but would provide a
good starting point.
