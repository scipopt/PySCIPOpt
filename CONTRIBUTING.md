Contributing to PySCIPOpt
=========================

Code contributions are very welcome and should comply to a few rules:

0.  Read Design principles of PySCIPOpt\_.
1.  Compatibility with both Python-2 and Python-3.
2.  All tests defined in the Continuous Integration setup need to pass:
    -   [.travis.yml](../../.travis.yml)
    -   [appveyor.yml](../../appveyor.yml)

3.  New features should be covered by tests *and* examples. Please
    extend [tests](tests) and [examples](examples). Tests uses pytest
    and examples are meant to be accessible for PySCIPOpt newcomers
    (even advanced examples).
4.  New code should be documented in the same style as the rest of
    the code.
5.  New code should be
    [pep8-compliant](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Help
    yourself with the [style guide
    checker](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/).
6.  Before implementing a new PySCIPOpt feature, check whether the
    feature exists in SCIP. If so, implement it as a pure wrapper,
    mimicking SCIP whenever possible. If the new feature does not exist
    in SCIP but it is close to an existing one, consider if implementing
    that way is substantially convenient (e.g. Pythonic). If it does
    something completely different, you are welcome to pull your request
    and discuss the implementation.
7.  PySCIPOpt uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Version
    number increase only happens on master and must be tagged to build a
    new PyPI release.

For general reference, we suggest:

-   [PySCIPOpt README](README.md);
-   [SCIP documentation](http://scip.zib.de/doc/html/);
-   [SCIP mailing list](https://listserv.zib.de/mailman/listinfo/scip/)
    which can be easily searched with search engines (e.g.
    [Google](http://www.google.com/#q=site:listserv.zib.de%2Fpipermail%2Fscip));
-   [open and closed PySCIPOpt
    issues](https://github.com/SCIP-Interfaces/PySCIPOpt/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue);
-   [SCIP/PySCIPOpt Stack
    Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scip).

Design principles of PySCIPOpt
==============================

PySCIPOpt is meant to be a fast-prototyping interface of the pure SCIP C
API. By design, we distinguish different functions in PySCIPOPT:

-   pure wrapping functions of SCIP;
-   convenience functions.

**PySCIPOpt wrappers of SCIP functions** should act:

-   with an expected behavior - and parameters, returns, attributes, ...
    - as close to SCIP as possible
-   without *"breaking"* Python and the purpose for what the language it
    is meant.

Ideally speaking, we want every SCIP function to be wrapped in
PySCIPOpt.

**Convenience functions** are additional, non-detrimental features meant
to help prototyping the Python way. Since these functions are not in
SCIP, we wish to limit them to prevent difference in features between
SCIP and PySCIPOPT, which are always difficult to maintain. A few
convenience functions survive in PySCIPOpt when keeping them is
doubtless beneficial.

Admittedly, *there is a middle ground where functions are not completely
wrappers or just convenient*. That is the case, for instance, of
fundamental `Model`{.sourceCode} methods like `addCons`{.sourceCode} or
`writeProblem`{.sourceCode}. We want to leave their development to
negotiation.
