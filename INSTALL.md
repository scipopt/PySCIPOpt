Requirements
============

PySCIPOpt requires a working installation of the [SCIP Optimization
Suite](https://www.scipopt.org/). Please, make sure that your SCIP installation works!

**Note that the latest PySCIPOpt version is usually only compatible with the latest major release of the SCIP Optimization Suite. See the table on the README.md page for details.**

If SCIP is not installed in the global path
you need to specify the install location using the environment variable
`SCIPOPTDIR`:

-   on Linux and OS X:\
    `export SCIPOPTDIR=<path_to_install_dir>`
-   on Windows:\
    `set SCIPOPTDIR=<path_to_install_dir>` (**cmd**, **Cmder**, **WSL**)\
    `$Env:SCIPOPTDIR = "<path_to_install_dir>"` (**powershell**)

`SCIPOPTDIR` needs to have a subdirectory `lib` that contains the
library, e.g. `libscip.so` (for Linux) and a subdirectory `include` that
contains the corresponding header files:

    SCIPOPTDIR
      > lib
        > libscip.so ...
      > include
        > scip
        > lpi
        > nlpi
        > ...

If you are not using the installer packages, you need to [install the
SCIP Optimization Suite using CMake](https://www.scipopt.org/doc/html/md_INSTALL.php#CMAKE).
The Makefile system is not compatible with PySCIPOpt!

On Windows it is highly recommended to use the [Anaconda Python
Platform](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Installation from PyPI
======================

    python -m pip install pyscipopt

On Windows you may need to ensure that the `scip` library can be found
at runtime by adjusting your `PATH` environment variable:

-   on Windows: `set PATH=%PATH%;%SCIPOPTDIR%\bin`

On Linux and OS X this is encoded in the generated PySCIPOpt library and
therefore not necessary.

Building everything from source
===============================

Recommended is to install in a virtual environment (e.g. `python3 -m venv <DIR_PATH>`).
Please note that a globally installed version of PySCIPOpt on your machine might lead to problems.

After setting up and activating your virtual environment (`source <DIR_PATH>/bin/activate`) make sure you have [Cython](http://cython.org/) installed, at least version 0.21

    pip install cython

Note you will also need the `wheel` package, which usually is already installed:

    pip install wheel

Furthermore, you need to have the Python
development files installed on your system (error message "Python.h not
found"):

    sudo apt-get install python-dev   # for Python 2, on Linux
    sudo apt-get install python3-dev  # for Python 3, on Linux

After setting up `SCIPOPTDIR` as specified above install pyscipopt

    export SCIPOPTDIR=/path/to/scip/install/dir
    python -m pip install [-e] .

For recompiling the source in the current directory `.` use

    python -m pip install --compile .

Building with debug information
===============================

To use debug information in PySCIPOpt you need to build it like this:

    python -m pip install --install-option="--debug" .

Be aware that you will need the **debug library** of the SCIP
Optimization Suite for this to work
(`cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`).

Testing new installation
========================

To test your brand-new installation of PySCIPOpt you need
[pytest](https://pytest.org/) on your system.

    pip install pytest

Here is the complete [installation
procedure](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html).

Tests can be run in the `PySCIPOpt` directory with: :

    py.test # all the available tests
    py.test tests/test_name.py # a specific tests/test_name.py (Unix)

Ideally, the status of your tests must be passed or skipped. Running
tests with pytest creates the `__pycache__` directory in `tests` and,
occasionally, a `model` file in the working directory. They can be
removed harmlessly.

Common errors
=============

-   readline: `libreadline.so.6: undefined symbol: PC` This is a
    readline/ncurses compatibility issue that can be fixed like this
    (when using `conda`):

        conda install -c conda-forge readline=6.2
